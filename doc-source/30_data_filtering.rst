Introduction
=============

In this chapter filtering techniques that allow pre-processing of GC-MS data for analysis and comparison to other pre-processed GC-MS data are covered.

Time strings
==============

Before considering the filtering techniques, the mechanism for representing retention times is outlined here.

A time string is the specification of a time interval, that takes the format ``NUMBERs`` or ``NUMBERm`` for time interval in seconds or minutes. For example, these are valid time strings: ``10s`` (10 seconds) and ``0.2m`` (0.2 minutes).

The resulting :class:`~pyms.IntensityMatrix.IntensityMatrix` object can be "dumped" to a file for later
retrieval. There are general perpose object file handling methods in
:py:meth:`pyms.Utils.IO <pyms.Utils.IO>`. For example;

    >>> from pyms.Utils.IO import dump_object
    >>> dump_object(im, "output/im-proc.dump")
