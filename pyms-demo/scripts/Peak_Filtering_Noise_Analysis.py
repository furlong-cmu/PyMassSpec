# # Noise analysis for peak filtering
# 
# In the previous example the cutoff parameter for peak filtering was set by the
# user. This can work well for individual data files, but can cause problems when
# applied to large experiments with many individual data files. Where experimental
# conditions have changed slightly between experimental runs, the ion intensity
# over the GC-MS run may also change. This means that an inflexible cutoff value
# can work for some data files, while excluding too many, or including too many
# peaks in other files.
# 
# An alternative to manually setting the value for cutoff is to use the
# |window_analyzer()| function. This function examines a Total Ion Chromatogram
# (TIC) and computes a value for the median absolute deviation in troughs between
# peaks. This gives an approximate threshold value above which false peaks from
# noise should be filtered out.
# 
# First, build the Peak list as before
