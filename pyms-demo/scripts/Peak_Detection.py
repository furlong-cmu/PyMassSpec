# First, setup the paths to the datafiles and the output directory, then import JCAMP_reader and build_intensity_matrix.

# In[16]:


import pathlib
data_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve().parent.parent / "pyms-data"
# Change this if the data files are stored in a different location

output_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve() / "output"

from pyms.GCMS.IO.JCAMP import JCAMP_reader
from pyms.IntensityMatrix import build_intensity_matrix


# Read the raw data file and build the |IntensityMatrix|.

# In[17]:


jcamp_file = data_directory / "gc01_0812_066.jdx"
data = JCAMP_reader(jcamp_file)
im = build_intensity_matrix(data)


# Preprocess the data (Savitzky-Golay smoothing and Tophat baseline detection

# In[18]:


from pyms.Noise.SavitzkyGolay import savitzky_golay
from pyms.TopHat import tophat

n_scan, n_mz = im.size

for ii in range(n_mz):
    ic = im.get_ic_at_index(ii)
    ic_smooth = savitzky_golay(ic)
    ic_bc = tophat(ic_smooth, struct="1.5m")
    im.set_ic_at_index(ii, ic_bc)


# Now the Biller and Biemann based technique can be applied to detect peaks.

# In[19]:


from pyms.BillerBiemann import BillerBiemann
peak_list = BillerBiemann(im)
print(peak_list[:10])


# In[20]:


len(peak_list)


# Note that this is nearly as many peaks as there are scans in the data
# (9865 scans). This is due to noise and the simplicity of the technique.
# 
# The number of detected peaks can be constrained by the selection of better
# parameters. Parameters can be determined by counting the number of points
# across a peak, and examining where peaks are found. For example, the peak
# list can be found with the parameters of a window of 9 points and by
# combining 2 neighbouring scans if they apex next to each other:
# 

# In[21]:


peak_list = BillerBiemann(im, points=9, scans=2)
print(peak_list[:10])


# In[22]:


len(peak_list)


# The number of detected peaks has been reduced, but there are still many more
# than would be expected from the sample. Functions to filter the peak list are
# covered in the next example.
# 
# ## Example: Peak List Filtering
# 
# There are two functions to filter the list of Peak objects.
# 
# The first, |rel_threshold()| modifies the mass spectrum stored in each peak so
# any intensity that is less than a given percentage of the maximum intensity for the peak is removed.
# 
# The second, |num_ions_threshold()|, removes any peak that has less than a given
# number of ions above a given threshold.
# 
# Once the peak list has been constructed, the filters can be applied as follows:

# In[23]:


from pyms.BillerBiemann import rel_threshold, num_ions_threshold
pl = rel_threshold(peak_list, percent=2)
print(pl[:10])


# In[24]:


new_peak_list = num_ions_threshold(pl, n=3, cutoff=10000)
print(new_peak_list[:10])


# In[25]:


len(new_peak_list)


# The number of detected peaks is now more realistic of what would be expected in
# the test sample.
