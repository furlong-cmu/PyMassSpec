# # Example: Peak Objects
# 
# Fundamental to GC-MS analysis is the identification of individual components of
# the sample mix. The basic component unit is represented as a signal peak. 
# In PyMassSpec a signal peak is represented as |Peak| object. PyMassSpec provides
# functions to detect peaks and create peaks (discussed at the end of the chapter).
# 
# A peak object stores a minimal set of information about a signal peak, namely,
# the retention time at which the peak apex occurs and the mass spectra at the 
# apex. Additional information, such as, peak width, TIC and individual ion 
# areas can be filtered from the GC-MS data and added to the Peak object
# information.
# 
# 
# ## Creating a Peak Object
# 
# A peak object can be created for a scan at a given retention time by providing
# the retention time (in minutes or seconds) and the |MassSpectrum| object of the
# scan.
# 
# First, setup the paths to the datafiles and the output directory, then import JCAMP_reader.

# In[1]:


import pathlib
data_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve().parent.parent / "pyms-data"
# Change this if the data files are stored in a different location

output_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve() / "output"

from pyms.GCMS.IO.JCAMP import JCAMP_reader


# Read the raw data files.

# In[2]:


jcamp_file = data_directory / "gc01_0812_066.jdx"
data = JCAMP_reader(jcamp_file)


# Build the |IntensityMatrix|.

# In[3]:


from pyms.IntensityMatrix import build_intensity_matrix_i

im = build_intensity_matrix_i(data)


# Extract the |MassSpectrum| at 31.17 minutes in this example.

# In[4]:


index = im.get_index_at_time(31.17*60.0)
ms = im.get_ms_at_index(index)


# Create a |Peak| object for the given retention time.

# In[5]:


from pyms.Peak.Class import Peak
peak = Peak(31.17, ms, minutes=True)


# By default the retention time is assumed to be in seconds. The parameter 
# ``minutes`` can be set to ``True`` if the retention time is given in minutes.
# Internally, PyMassSpec stores retention times in seconds, so the ``minutes``
# parameter ensures the input and output of the retention time are in the same
# units.
# 
# ## Peak Object properties
# 
# The retention time of the peak, in seconds, can be returned with |pyms.Peak.Class.Peak.rt|. 
# The mass spectrum can be returned with |pyms.Peak.Class.Peak.mass_spectrum|.
# 
# The |Peak| object constructs a unique identification (UID) based on the spectrum
# and retention time. This helps in managing lists of peaks (covered in the next
# chapter). The UID can be returned with |pyms.Peak.Class.Peak.UID|. The format
# of the UID is the masses of the two most abundant ions in the spectrum, the
# ratio of the abundances of the two ions, and the retention time (in the same
# units as given when the Peak object was created). The format is:
# 

# 
# Mass1-Mass2-Ratio-RT
# 

# For example:

# In[6]:


print(peak.rt)


# In[7]:


print(peak.UID)


# In[8]:


index = im.get_index_of_mass(73.3)

print(index)


# ## Modifying a Peak Object
# 
# The Peak object has methods for modifying the mass spectrum. The mass range can
# be cropped to a smaller range with |crop_mass()|, and the intensity values for
# a single ion can be set to zero with |null_mass()|. For example, the mass range
# can be set from 60 to 450 |m/z|, and the ions related to sample preparation can
# be ignored by setting their intensities to zero as follows:

# In[9]:


peak.crop_mass(60, 450)
peak.null_mass(73)
peak.null_mass(147)


# The UID is automatically updated to reflect the changes:

# In[10]:


print(peak.UID)


# It is also possible to change the peak mass spectrum by setting the attribute |pyms.Peak.Class.Peak.mass_spectrum|.
