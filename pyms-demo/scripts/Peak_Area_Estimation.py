# # Peak Area Estimation
# 
# The |Peak| object does not contain any information about the width or area of
# the peak when it is first created. This information can be added after the 
# instantiation of a Peak object. The area of the peak can be set with the 
# attribute |pyms.Peak.Class.Peak.area|, or with the method |set_ion_areas()|.
# 
# The total peak area can by obtained by the |peak_sum_area()| function in
# |pyms.Peak.Function|. The function determines the total area as the sum of the
# ion intensities for all masses that apex at the given peak. To calculate the
# peak area of a single mass, the intensities are added from the apex of the
# mass peak outwards.
# 
# Edge values are added until the following conditions are met:
# * the added intensity adds less than 0.5\% to the accumulated area; or
# * the added intensity starts increasing (i.e. when the ion is common to
#   co-eluting compounds).
# 
# To avoid noise effects, the edge value is taken at the midpoint of three consecutive edge values.
# 
# First, build the Peak list as before
